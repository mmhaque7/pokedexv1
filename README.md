# Pokedex Web App

## Project Overview

This Pokedex web application is built using **Next.js**, **NextUI**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to browse and search for Pokémon, displaying detailed information about each one by fetching data from the **[PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)**. The app provides a smooth and responsive interface optimized for performance and scalability.
